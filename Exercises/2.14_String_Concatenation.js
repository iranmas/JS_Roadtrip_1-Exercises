// Video 2.4 accompanies this exercise

// Use the same twenty20 variable, but change your variableâ€™s contents
// by reassigning it to the concatenation of the following characters:
//
// - The character at index 0 in "Never look back."
// - The character at index 3 in "Adventure is out there."
// - The character at index 14 in "Just keep swimming."
// - The character at index 1 in "To infinity... and beyond!"
//
// In the console, execute this concatenation in one line without
// declaring any extra variables. You can use a method to find the
// characters, or count very carefully. Then enter twenty20.

const index0 ="Never loo back"[0]
const index1 ="Adventure is out there"[3]
const index2 ="Just keep swimming"[14]
const index3 ="To infinity... and beyond!"[1]

console.log(index0 + index1 +index2 + index3);
